            "OriginText": "In light of the global shift towards sustainable energy, the Japan Electric Institute has made a forecast for future electricity generation sources. They predict that the renewables will continuously increase and reach 211 billion kilowatt hours in 2040. Meanwhile, natural gas, having reached 408 billion kilowatt hours in 2015, is predicted to consistently remain above 400 billion kilowatter hours. The liquid is predicted to reach 4 billion kilowatter hours in 2040. The nuclear energy in Japan, severely impacted by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, recorded a production of only 3 billion kilowatt hours in 2015. Currently, due to its reliability and abundance, the most commonly used feedstock for electricity generation is now natural gas, which is expected to reach 438 billion kilowatt hours in 2040. It underscores the pivotal role of natural gas in Japan's energy landscape.",
